# GeRuDok

GeRuDok is a generic document manager, capable of creating and editing documents,
organized into pages, elements slots and elements (textual and graphical). All of
those are organized into projects and workspaces, which can be saved, loaded,
shared, etc. It is an exercise in object-oriented software design and
architecture, with the aim to create a minimally specific application operating
on polymorphic hierarchical structures.

It was created as a school project, and built to precise specifications given by
the course supervisor.
